# TriPy: A Python Programming Model For TensorRT

TriPy is a Python programming model for TensorRT that aims to provide an excellent
user experience without compromising performance. Some of the features of TriPy include:

- **Intuitive API**: TriPy doesn't reinvent the wheel: If you have used NumPy or
    PyTorch before, TriPy APIs should feel familiar.

- **Excellent Error Messages**: When something goes wrong, TriPy tries to provide
    informative and actionable error messages. Even in cases where the error comes
    from deep within the software stack, Tripy is able to map it back to the Python code
    that caused it.
