# Contributing to MLIR-TensorRT

Contributions are welcome!

## Coding Standard

We will strive to follow the same coding standard as upstream MLIR, which is
described here: https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html

Python files are formatted using the [`black` formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## How to Submit a PR

- Fork the repo on GitHub
- Use GitHub CLI to submit PRs.

Make sure you push your branches to your fork instead of the main repo.

```bash
git remote add fork [url to your fork]
```

1. Checkout a branch ```git switch -c my-feature```
2. Do work
3. `git clang-format HEAD~1`
4. `git stage` your files and `git commit -s` with a message following guidelines
   below. Commits must contain a "sign off" message to indicate that the code you are
   contributing is your own work and contributed under our existing license.
5. `git push fork`
6. `gh pr create`


### Testing

Until we have some sort of automated externally-facing continuous testing setup, we will test PRs
using our internal infrastructure. In the meantime, developers should post their own test
results to the PR as a comment for the most basic sanity check. Just post the output of

```
ninja -C build check-mlir-tensorrt check-mlir-executor check-mlir-tensorrt-dialect
```

### Merging PRs

After review, when it is time to merge the change, simply do:

1. `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`

## Guidelines for PRs

Each PR is one commit. Multiple commits will be automatically squashed. We are
operating in git fast-forward-only mode, so you will need to rebase periodically
if you are on a long-lived branch.

Each commit should generally  follow a multi-line style as follows:

```
[SomeTag] A short headline

Explanation of what the commit entails. It can be as long as you like, the more
detail the better. No functional change should be made without an explanation.
```

The exception to this policy is for "Non-Functional-Changes" (NFC)
commits which are things like correcting typos and updating documentation
in that case it's fine to have something like:

```NFC: fix typo in documentation```

Functional changes and bug fixes should have an accompanying test.
Usually this will be in the form of a LIT test.

Each commit should be focused and atomic. Break your work up into small commits
as much as possible.

#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies
  that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it
  under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be
    accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when
  committing your changes:

  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
